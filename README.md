source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
# For Windows
# .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

- Detected vulnerabilities

### Example:

```bash
Enter the website URL (e.g., https://example.com): https://example.com
```
